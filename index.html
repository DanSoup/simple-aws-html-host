  <h1>A simple AWS HTML host</h1>
  <p>A really simple boilerplate for HTML apps I want to host using my AWS hosting solution.</p>
  <p>This site is hosted on S3 and distributed via CloudFront. A Lambda@Edge function handles requests and redirects them where appropriate. This redirecting is needed because some pages on dansoup.co.uk are single page apps that handle the routing themselves. This is done by checking if the requested HTML file is present in the S3 bucket but only when no extension is specified in the URL.</p>
